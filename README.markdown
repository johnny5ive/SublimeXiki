WIP Xiki plugin for Sublime Text 2

To use: open the command pallete (cmd+shift+p or ctrl+shift+p) and use "Create Xiki Buffer"

Test it by typing a command like "docs" and pressing cmd+enter on OS X (or ctrl+enter on different platforms)

There is still much to do.

Forked by JohnnyFive to play around with.
